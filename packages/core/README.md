## Exceptionless Core

This package is the main source of methods that inform all of the other Exceptionless JS packages. It should not be used directly. Instead, you should use one of the following pagages: 

`@exceptionless/browser`
`@exceptionless/node`
`@exceptionless/react`
`@exceptionless/angular`
