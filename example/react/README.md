## Exceptionless React Example

This example shows how to use the `@exceptionless/react` package. There is both a class component example (App.js) and a function component example with hooks (HooksExampleApp.js).

The package includes [error boundary support](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) which means uncaught errors inside your components will automatically be sent to Exceptionless.

To run locally, follow these steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript`
2. `cd Exceptionless.Javascript`
3. `npm install`
4. `cd example/react`
5. `npm start`

Reference the main `@exceptionless/react` [README](../../packages/react/README.md) here when building your own React app.
